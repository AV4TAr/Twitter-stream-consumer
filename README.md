Twitter stream tracker
======================

The intention of this is to learn how mongodb works, and do some frontend realtime updates (using node.js and some queueing).

So, its a quick and dirty (very kiss) app to monitor a twitter stream, store it in mongoDB and then showing it live.


v1.
---
Quick and dirty version.
  - Get the stream up and running
  - store tweets in a mongo collection
  - show tweets in a page using ajax (not live yet)

v1.5.
-----
  - Count retweets (voting) and show top ranked tweets.
  - Add configuration pannel to control and configure the stram.

v2.
---
  - Real time updates in the frontend
